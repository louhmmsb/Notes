#+title: Tree Sitter

* Tree-sitter
Tree-sitter is a tool which provides syntax highlighting for many text editors using a AST.

From version 29 onwards, Emacs has native tree-sitter support, but for it to actually work, some steps must be followed.

First, build and install Emacs as follows (it's also important to have the tree-sitter package/program installed):
#+begin_src bash
  git clone https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs.git
  cd emacs
  git checkout emacs-29.0.50
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --with-native-compilation --with-modules --with-json --with-cairo --with-tree-sitter
  make -j4
  sudo make install
#+end_src

After, install the [[https://github.com/casouri/tree-sitter-module/][tree-sitter module]] and build the grammars. Move the grammars to the file specified by the ~treesit-extra-load-path~. In [[id:b06bfbc8-1484-4818-b89c-30bb6ef8be1b][My Emacs Config]], the variable is set to ~~/.emacs.d/tree-sitter~.
A more in depth tutorial on how to do this can be found [[https://blog.markhepburn.com/posts/experimenting-with-the-built-in-treesitter-support-in-emacs/][here]].
