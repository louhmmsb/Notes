#+title: Projectile

Projectile is an Emacs package used to manage projects.

* Configuration
Projectile can be configured per project using through the file ~.dirs-locals.el~ inside the project root.
Example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ((nil . ((projectile-project-run-cmd . "mvn spring-boot:run")
            (projectile-project-install-cmd . "mvn install"))))
#+end_src
The above configuration makes projectile know which command should be used to run and to install a specific project (in this case it's a spring boot project).
Documentation on how to configure more features can be found on the [[https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/projects.html#storing-project-settings][projectile documentation]].
