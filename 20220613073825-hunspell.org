#+title: Hunspell

Hunspell is a spell checker program and [[id:e6bd5830-8352-46c5-98a1-20ad1fe5fcd4][Emacs]] uses it for correcting spelling mistakes.

I downloaded all the .aff and .dic files from https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries.

For it to work I need to put all the .aff files and .dic inside /usr/share/hunspell.
