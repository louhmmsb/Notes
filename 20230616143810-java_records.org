#+title: Java Records

Java records are a programming resource, released officially in Java 16, which allows the programmer to create immutable classes. This is really useful to represent *data* like when creating itermediate models between json strings and the model used by the application. To create one, simply use the keyword ~record~
instead of ~class~.
