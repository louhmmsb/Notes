#+title: Doom Emacs

* Language servers
To install eslint in doom emacs just do ~M-x lsp-install-server RET eslint RET~.

* Useful commands
In doom emacs, to open the menu of a project inside ~counsel-projectile-switch-project~, instead of ~M-x o~, it's ~C-x o~ (the name of the function that does that is ~ivy-dispatching-done~ I think).
